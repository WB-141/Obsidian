This method is used to inoculate the [[Host Plants]] with a sample from a leaf containing a potential virus. The [[Host Plants]] will be covered with a light layer of carborundum, carborundum or silicone carbide is a sharp particle that will help to create incisions. The mechanical inoculation is done with a cotton swab, see [[List of consumables]].
#### How to inoculate
![[Pasted image 20250721104850.png]]

1. Find the first pair of leaves after the newest grown leaves
2. Support the leaves
3. Get the cotton swab out of the sample
4. Move the cotton swab from close to the stem to the point of the leaf
Indicator plants is a test/requirement to give the plants an elite certificate. Protocol about this test can be found on [Reliance](https://syngenta.etq.com/prod/rel/#/app/system/portal), protocol number [#02151](https://syngenta.etq.com/prod/rel/#/app/system/document/DOCWORK/DOCWORK_DOCUMENT/247337).

The plants in the indicator test can be found in [[Host Plants]], the inoculation method used is [[Mechanical Inoculation]].

List of items needed for the test can be found here: [[List of consumables]]

#### After inoculation
After inoculation wait up to 5 minutes to give the sample time to enter the [[Host Plants]]. After that spray the plants down with water to remove any access carborundum.

#### Note
In one set there are 3 different plants, each plant has a different leaf structure and different pressure during inoculation is needed. In the list below the plants are ordered in the amount of pressure it needs, from most to least.

1. [[Chenopodium Quinoa]]]
2. [[Nicotiana occidentalis]]
3. [[Nicotiana Benthamiana]]
